### Objective
To facilitate creaters and harvesters to sell to their neighbors on an ongoing basis without the hassels of bigger marketplace websites.

### Motivation
Team member Karen and her husband are urban farmers and creaters and dislike the current options for notifying their neighbors when they have products for sale. Team members Earl and Rob also have family and friends who are looking for better opportunites for local, small-market sales.

## User Stories
Karen and Mike sell eggs and honey. They don't like facebook but it's the only way to the their neighbors know when new harvests are in. They would love an app that would allow them a little home to display their wares and respond to buyer inquiries.
 
 Jane is laid off from her job due to Covid19. She bakes cakes and cookies and could sell them for extra money. She needs a platform to let people in her area know of her new goods and chat with her about orders. She would like to have a page of her own to show her unique style.
 
Megan has missed being able to sell her jewelry at local markets. Her hobby of making jewelry is an easy source of extra income, but she needs a place to sell her goods as they get lost in the bigger sites. She would like to stand out more than in a larger nationwide store.
